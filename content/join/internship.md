# Research Internships

If you are interested in interning in the HydroSense Lab, please read this carefully.

There are multiple ways to intern with us:

* Through the official internship programs of IIT Delhi (Internal/External)
* Directly by the lab

# Who we are
* A fledgling lab with the MISSION of developing innovative solutions for water, weather, and climate change issues at local to global scales. We want to better understand various aspects of the water cycle.
* Our GOAL right now is to develop monitoring and forecasting systems for floods and droughts using physical modeling and machine learning. 
* We are a very collaborative team.  Open-source, open-communication, and open-science is fundamental to how we operate.

# What will be expected from you
The outcome of an internship in our lab is always a product or a paper. This will require sincere effort over a significant amount of time. We don't offer short-term internships for the sake of certificates. We offer outcome-based ones where there is some useful output at the end. We put in significant effort into training interns and expect diligence and commitment in return. Here are a few conditions that you will have to accept before you start working with us:
* You must be willing to put in 1 or 2 hours of focused work everyday if the internship is during the session and 8 hours if it is during vacation period.                                 
* You will not share data and results from our lab with anyone without approval. This is particularly true if our papers are under review and you are emailing other people for career opportunities.

# What you will get
* Advanced computational and research skills suitable for industry and academia.
* Co-authorship in all publications based on your relative contribution.
* A strong recommendation letter contingent upon making satisfactory progress in your work. 

# What you are expected to have
We don't require prior skills for any internship. But special consideration will be given to anyone with programming experience. We make extensive usage of Python, R, FORTRAN, React Native, Django etc. Most of all, we are looking for motivated students who want to make a difference through their work. Your GPA or college ranking doesn't matter to me. What matters is having a curious mind, willingness to learn, and drive to deliver. 

Our lab is committed to diversity and inclusion in every aspect.

Please send me your CV if you are interested.
