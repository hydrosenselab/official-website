## Published Research
1. [Rainfall Erosivity over India](#erosivity-india) | [Download Indian Rainfall Erosivity Dataset (IRED)](https://zenodo.org/record/6470233) | [Publication (CATENA)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2022.106256) | Lead: Ravi Raj ( IITD) 

### Mapping rainfall erosivity over India using multiple precipitation datasets <a name="erosivity-india"></a>

- This is the first national-scale assessment of rainfall erosivity over India using multiple gridded precipitation datasets
- R-factor map for India using high resolution gridded precipitation data, highlighting the rainfall-erosivity-prone areas and analyzing the sensitivity of the method chosen to estimate rainfall erosivity over India.
- Four power law equations (R = α*MFI^β) were also recommended to estimate rainfall erosivity with the help of MFI in the absence of highresolution precipitation datasets.
