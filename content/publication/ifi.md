abstract = "Floods are one of the most devastating natural hazards across the world, with India being one of the worst affected countries in terms of fatalities and economic damage. In-depth research is required inorder to understand the complex hydrometeorological and geomorphic factors at play and design solutionsto minimize the impactof floods. But the existence ofahistorical31inventory of floods is imperative to promote such research endeavors. Though, a few global inventories exist, they lack the spatio-temporal fidelity necessary to make them useful for 33computational  research due  to  reasons such  asconcentrating  exclusively  on  large  floods, limitedtemporal scope, non-standard data formats etc. Therefore,there is an urgentneed for developinga new database thatcombines data from global and hitherto-underutilized local 36datasets using an extensible and common schema. This paper describes the ongoing effort of 37buildingthe India Flood Inventory (IFI),which isthefirst freely-available, analysis-ready 38geospatial dataset over  the  region with  detailed  qualitative  and  quantitative  information regarding floods, including spatial extents. Thepaper outlines the methodology that has been adoptedas well as some preliminary findings using the data contained in this inventory. This datasetis expectedto advance the understanding of flood processes in the worst affected region of the world."
